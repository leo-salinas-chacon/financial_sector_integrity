# financial_sector_integrity

With the recent events that happened with Silicon Valley Bank in 2023, and the ensuing panic that happened at a smaller scale. I wanted to check the integrity of the finanical system according to the Federal Reserve. As they are the ones that are supposed to keep track of the health of the financial system. 

This repo will focus on displaying and comparing the changes in Deposits, liabilities, their respective break downs, and residuals to see the changes in the fiancial sector as how they compare before the 2008 financial crisis, during the covid-19 era, and now post Covid-19.
